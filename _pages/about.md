Joint postdoc between CNRS Paris with the team of Simon Apers at IRIF and ULB with the team of Jérémie Roland at QuIC.

Great interest in theoretical computer science and physics. You can access to my publication at [publications page](/publications/).

I have an extra interest in experiential understanding of different conscious states.
